- hxnormalize with option -x (produce XML syntax) could replace an
  HTML4 doctype with one for XHTML1.
- An option for hxnormalize to allow to break lines before the '>' of tags?
- An option -d to hxwls for maximum recursion depth

Suggestions from Werner Heuser <werner.heuser@web.de>

- `printlinks' is a great help, but I would like some links not
  to be touched, e.g. some graphics.

- please include a download URL into the source. Imagine somebody
  likes the program and wants to come back and get the current
  version


* Proprietary extensions

Microsoft Internet Explorer accepts a proprietary extension to HTML
that looks like malformed mark-up: "<![if xxx]>" or "<![endif]>"
(where xxx is text that doesn't contain "]"). The parser currently
reports (correctly) a syntax error. Should there be a mode in which
this is accepted? If so, as what? as TEXT?


 - An option for hxindex to remove TITLE attributes that were used?
   This avoids that strange-looking titles with || or !! remain in the
   document.
